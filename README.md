### A Tour of Go

This is a repository of my solutions to the exercises in [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1)

Do take note that the code needs to be run in the tour playground. Alternatively, you can run the tour locally by fist installing Go and then running:

```
go install golang.org/x/website/tour@latest
```
